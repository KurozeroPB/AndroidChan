# Image-Search
Android app to search for images from [konachan.net](http://konachan.net)

To start off, this is my first android app so bugs and errors are no doubt in the code.

Functionality & How to use the app

    To search for something just fill in the things you want to search for in the TextInput field. See image to the right.<br>
    Click on the `search` button and it will fetch an image for you.
    Keeping the text input empty will fetch a completely random image.<br>

    Once we've searched for an image the save button will unlock.<br>
    Now we can save the image to our phone.<br>
    An alternative option to save images to to hold your finger on the image for 1 second and select `Download Image` from the menu.<br>

    If you want to go to the post on konachan's website it self just click on the link that is shown above the `Next` button.<br>
    To get a new image you can click on the `Next` button and the app will fetch a new image for you.<br>
    To view explicit content you can click on the check box in the left bottom corner, a popup will come up to verify if you really want to enable it.<br>
    Click `yes` if you're sure about it, click `no` if you rather don't want explicit content.<br>
    Disable explicit content by clicking on the check box again.<br>
  </p>
</div>
<br><br><br>
Want to search for something new?<br>
Just change it in the TextInput field that I showed at the beginning and hit `Search` again.<br>
